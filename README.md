# Sepsis-Prediction
Sepsis is a major concern in a health care industry with high mortality rate. Therefore, it necessary for us to predict it early for intervening with treatment which would decrease the mortality rate. An appropriate model with a good prediction is necessary as the false predictions would increase the consumption of limited hospital resources. The model with the best prediction is to be selected by conducting various experiments through machine learning models. Na√Øve Bayes, Ada Boost, Random Forest and Resnet machine learning models are used for the classification of Sepsis data. Imbalanced sepsis data set and balanced dataset using SMOTE are used for the analysis. The Labels are shifted forward to predict the onset of sepsis early. The investigation is then run on the dataset with shifted labels. The best classifier for each of the shifted dataset is to be selected with the performance evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, F1- Score, sensitivity, and specificity. Random forest classifier with over sampling technique outperforms the other classifiers with the high accuracy score of 95%, low sensitivity value of 44%, high specificity value 99% and a high F1 score of 70%.
